        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Brenda Jimenez is a creative innovator who seeks a role of leadership and commitment. I have a focus on the marketing of beauty brands and the ways businesses may be able to improve their engagement with customers and other brands. The focus and drive of entering this field has been held by always loving and striving to make things better and to not settle for less. By being able to seek new innovations and ways to gain more attraction towards the business, the more successful the business will be. <br><br>

        My upbringing has truly set forth a path for me to never let the bar be low and strive to surpass my expectations. I graduated Santiago High School in 2019 and am currently a second year Business Administration student at the University of California, Riverside. Through my years in high school, I was an active and responsible scholar and was able to receive outstanding grades and still be able to maintain sports. High school definitely taught me the type of person I was and wanted to still be, I really enjoyed beauty and makeup and definitely knew that was what I wanted to be involved with as I entered college. Through my years after high school, I have attended many workshops regarding the marketing process and have gone to forums to see other successful brands speak on their success and the necessities to make that happen. To really want the success of a brand to continue, it's important to have leaders who know how to communicate, are passionate about the thing they're working on, and know how to drive a thing forward and face obstacles.<br><br>

        Beyond what I have done regarding my major, I have also worked outside of this field, as a cashier at Target for two years, a babysitter for 1 year, and have participated in community work such as caring for the elderly. Through these jobs and work, I've been able to grasp a sense of perspective and learn how to be independent, ambitious, and a good communicator within people. My best traits come from having empathy and a good listener, which are traits that are important in regard to the relationships you have with your customers. My involvement in clubs throughout High School definitely helped me in being able to work with others and be able to branch off ideas to make better changes within certain aspects. As a college student now, my aims are driven towards an approach in helping brands and working to make their engagement improve within the social realm. I look at brands like Fenty Beauty, Rare, Beauty, etc and am so gravitated the work behind just the makeup, specifically how these brands are able to market themselves to appeal to so many people. I plan to find internships that will allow me to see the behind the scenes of how these brands work, and be able to learn from a hands on perspective.Through my experience with jobs, and being in college, I'm learning everyday to hold this ambition and seek opportunities that will help me get one step closer to what I truly want to do.
